* ERROR
** Extensible pRogRamming and cOmputing enviRonment
ERROR is my personal editor based on GNU/Emacs.
** Philosophy
ERROR has designed from ground up to be a configurable yet user-friendly solution for 
those who don't want heavy bloated IDEs and want something simple
yet powerfull.
** Terminology
ERROR has built around features. Basically ERROR itself is nothing but some simple macros that wrap the best Emacs package manager (straight.el)
and best package defenition macro (use-package), everything else is just feature. Each feature can consist of one or several packages.
