* Amirrezaask Emacs Configuration
My Emacs configuration is built on top of the idea of =features=. Features are smallest
pieces of configuration and most of the time they are configuration of a package so in summary
features are =package + configs=.
All feature related functions and macros are in =elisp/core.el=
Also there is a list of features and some basic configuration in =$HOME=
called =.emacs-features.el=.
