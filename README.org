* Hans
** Intro
=Hans= was named after legendary composer =Hans Zimmer=.

** Ideas
=Hans= is built around some main ideas, some of them are not implemented yet.
+ First class support for Emacs keybindings.
+ Startup time matters a lot so it should always stay fast as possible.
+ Core should remain as simple as possible.
+ KISS (keep it simple stupid).
+ Modularity comes first .
+ No duplicate packages, focus on one (ex helm & ivy)
+ Ability to install modules from third-party resources (TBA).
** Terminology
*** Core
=Hans= core consists of a few macros and functions, UI settings, and bootstrap code of =Hans=. This part should stay as small
as possible, and probably some day in the future UI should be dismantled from it as well. A breif introduction to some important
core macros
**** idle! 
=Hans= idle! macro takes multiple forms and evalutes them when Emacs is idle for 1 sec using =run-with-idle-timer=.
*** Modules
=Hans= modules are a mix of packages and configurations. They conventionaly created using =use-package=, maybe some day if we added
=Evil= we could customize macro to our needs (for keybindings for example).
