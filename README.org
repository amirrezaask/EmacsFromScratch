* Comrade
** Philosophy
Comrade has designed from ground up to be a configurable yet user-friendly solution for 
those who don't want heavy bloated IDEs and want something simple
yet powerfull.
** Terminology
Comrade has built around features. Basically Comrade itself is nothing but some simple macros that wrap the best Emacs package manager (straight.el)
and best package defenition macro (use-package), everything else is just feature. Each feature can consist of one or several packages.
